# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

First session on Saturday 2/11/2023 (9.00pm - 10.00pm EAT)
We had the first session where the course insctructors introduced themselves and Andrew (@andrewbrown) gave a high level overview of the learning outcomes of the 
course and the deliverables and expectations that need to be achieved on a weekly basis. There was some emphasis of going out of your way to really dive deep
into the project considering there is a lot of scope in the underlying architecture but the instructions remain relatively simple to accomodate all skill 
levels. 

We set up accounts on the lucid app and were shown how to get resources and come up with logical architecture. Chris Williams (@mistwire) took us through the process of coming up with the architecture. We were also introduced to the napkin / tissue method of 
coming up with architecture which is basically drawing out your architecture at a high level but in a way whose conceptual flow makes sense.

Margaret (@Margaretvaltie) went through the Project outline and gave a presentation of the flow of a customer engagement when you are tasked with assisting a client. It involved a presentation mimicking a typical interaction with a client and how to lead the conversation so as 
to get all the information necessary to start architecting.

We were tasked with completing the homework challenges for the week.
